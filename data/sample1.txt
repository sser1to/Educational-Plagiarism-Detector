Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems 
the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly 
programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can 
access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct 
experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better 
decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to 
allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and 
adjust actions accordingly.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data, helping predict 
outcomes for unforeseen data. The system is provided with labeled input-output pairs 
and learns to generalize from this data.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm learns from unlabeled data by identifying 
patterns and structures within the data. The system tries to learn the patterns and 
the structure from the data without any labels.

3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving 
rewards for correct actions and penalties for incorrect ones. The system learns to 
make a sequence of decisions by interacting with an environment.

Applications of machine learning include image recognition, natural language processing, 
recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, fraud detection, and many more fields that 
are revolutionizing how we interact with technology.
