Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning represents a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables 
systems to learn and improve automatically from experience without explicit programming. 
The focus of machine learning is on developing computer programs capable of accessing 
data and using it for self-learning.

Learning starts with data or observations such as examples, direct experience, or 
instruction to identify patterns and make improved decisions in the future. The main 
goal is enabling computers to learn independently without human help and modify their 
actions accordingly.

Main Categories of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning: This approach uses labeled training data to help the algorithm 
predict outcomes for new, unseen data. The system receives labeled input-output pairs 
and learns to make generalizations from this information.

2. Unsupervised Learning: Here, the algorithm works with unlabeled data, discovering 
patterns and structures on its own. The system attempts to understand patterns and 
structure without any predefined labels.

3. Reinforcement Learning: This method involves learning through experimentation, where 
the algorithm receives rewards for correct decisions and penalties for wrong ones. The 
system develops decision-making abilities by interacting with its environment.

Machine learning finds applications in various domains including image recognition, 
natural language processing, recommendation engines, self-driving cars, fraud detection, 
and numerous other areas that are transforming our technological interactions.
